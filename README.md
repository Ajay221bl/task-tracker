This is a Task Tracker App that runs in the CLI (Command Line Interface). The app is made for CLI. It can keep track of your daily tasks. You can add, update, delete a task. You can also change the status of task between todo, in-proogress, done. The tasks information is saved in the json file so that when you reload the app, it retrieves the tasks added during the previous execution.
